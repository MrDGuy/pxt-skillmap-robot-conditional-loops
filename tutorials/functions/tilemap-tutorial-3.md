# Using Tilemaps

## Introduction @unplugged

This tutorial teaches you to customize your tilemaps given already created tiles.

## Step One

Use the ``||tiles:set current tilemap to map ||`` code to start your robot on the start tile and set up the tilemap.

```python
tiles.load_map(tiles.create_map(tilemap(""" """)))
```

## Step Two @showhint

Change the dimensions to 10 x 7.

You should make as many types of tiles as you would like.  You must make a startTile and a goalTile. Make sure you name them exactly: startTile & goalTile.

## Step Four @showhint

Click the walls tool to create walls around the edge and any walls you want inside your robot's world.  If you choose to make walls in your world make sure they are different from the non-wall tiles.

## Step Five

Use the ``||robot:begin screen ||`` code to start your robot on the start tile and set up the tilemap.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
```

## Step Six

Use the ``||robot:move forward||`` code to move the robot. Change the direction the robot is facing with the ``||robot:turn right||`` and ``||robot:turn left||`` code.  Move the robot to the goal tile.

```python
robot.move_forward()
robot.turn_right()
robot.turn_left()
```


```customts
    game.onUpdate(function () {
        if (robot.goalReached()) {
            music.play(music.melodyPlayable(music.powerUp), music.PlaybackMode.UntilDone)
            game.splash("You reached the goal!")
            game.reset()
        }
    })
```
