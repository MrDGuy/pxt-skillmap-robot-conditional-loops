# Introduction to Functions!

## Functions @unplugged

Here is an example of how to use functions to improve your code's efficiency.  First push play to see what happens when the code runs.

## Defining Functions

Notice that there are two functions that start with def.  One function is name "move_turn_right" and the other is "move_turn_left".  Each ends the signature with a (): (two paretheses and a colon).
```python
def move_turn_right():
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.turn_right()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
def move_turn_left():
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.turn_left()
    robot.move_forward()
    robot.move_forward()
```

## Using Functions

When the function is called at the top of the code, each call will run the entirety of what is tabbed inside the function definition.  Also, robot is not in front since this function has been defined here and is not part of the robot library.

```python
move_turn_right()
move_turn_left()
```

## You will create your own functions to be used
This was just an introduction and you won't need to change any code.  Now move to the next activity and start writing your own functions!
